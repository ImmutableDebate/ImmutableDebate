# ImmutableDebate
Â© ImmutableDebate 2019

A blockchain use case for keeping track of personal/identifiable arguments during a discussion or debate.

1. Each blockchain is kept until the debate is settled
2. Once the debate is settled the blockchain can be archived
3. Each point and which person/organization/team etc makes that point is recorded on the blockchain
4. A consensus protocol can prevent sabotage of an argument made by another account

Example use case: If an organization goes through a long process of coming to a decision the process of coming to that decision
can easily be reviewed and the review trusted.

This can be apply to public and private blockchains.

For now the concept and general application is being posted to this GitHub.
