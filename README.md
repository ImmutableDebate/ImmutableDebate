# ImmutableDebate
Â© ImmutableDebate 2019

A blockchain use case for keeping track of personal/identifiable arguments during a discussion or debate.

## Concept
1. Each blockchain is kept until the debate is settled
2. Once the debate is settled the debate can be archived
3. Each point and which person/organization/team etc makes that point is recorded on the dapp
4. A consensus protocol can prevent sabotage of an argument made by another account

## Use Case
Example use case: If an organization goes through a long process of coming to a decision the process of coming to that decision
can easily be reviewed and the review trusted. If the decision is made across several locations miles apart the risk that a decision making process may be interfered with increases and the blockchain can resist attempts at doing this. Emails, for one, are at risk for being spoofed or tampered with.

## Private blockchains
This can be apply to public and private blockchains.


## Future development
For now the concept and general application is being posted to this GitHub.

Ultimately, there will be blockchain analytics that can analyze and breakdown decision-making processing that have been been made in an organization.
